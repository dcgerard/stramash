\title{Generate an object of class \code{normalmix} that is an
approximation to a Laplace distribution.}
\usage{
laplace_to_mix(mu, sig, gridsize = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{The location of the Laplace distribution.}

\item{sig}{The scale parameter of the Laplace distribution.}

\item{gridsize}{The number of mixture components to use. The larger
the more accurate the approximation, but the higher the
computational load --- especially if you intend to use this for
\code{\link{ash.workhorse}}.}
}
\description{
This is based on the representation of the Laplace distribution as
an exponential scale mixtures of normals.

\title{Multi-model Adaptive Shrinkage function}
\usage{
stramashm(betahat, sebetahat, mixcompdist = c("uniform", "halfuniform",
  "normal", "+uniform", "-uniform"), df = NULL, alpha = 2, ncores = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{betahat}{a p vector of estimates}

\item{sebetahat}{a p vector of corresponding standard errors}

\item{mixcompdist}{distribution of components in mixture. Default
is "uniform".}

\item{df}{appropriate degrees of freedom for (t) distribution of
betahat/sebetahat, default is NULL(Gaussian)}

\item{alpha}{Could be a vector of grid values in interval [0,1],
that this wrapper would select based on likelihood
principle. Could also be a positive integer greater or equal to
2, then alpha number of grid values would be generated from
[0,1], equally spaced. The default value is 2 that we compare
the EE and ET model.}

\item{ncores}{Whether to use parallel computing, defaults to FALSE,
user could specify number of cores they would like to
use. Further, if user does not specify and
length(betahat)>50000, then the function would perform parallel
computation using number of CPU cores on the current host.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to be passed to \code{\link{stramash}}.}
}
\value{
stramashm returns a list of objects
\item{beta.stramash}{the best fitted stramash object}
\item{loglikvector}{the vector of loglikelihood of various models}
\item{allstramash}{the fitted stramash of various models}
}
\description{
This is a wrapper function that takes a grid value of
    \eqn{alpha} and then consider the model \eqn{betahat_j /
    s_j^{alpha} ~ g()},and eqn{beta_j / s_j^{alpha} ~
    N(0,(sebetahat^(1-alpha))^2) or student t distribution}. When
    \eqn{alpha=0} we have the EE model, when \eqn{alpha=1}, we have
    the ET model. \eqn{alpha} should be in between 0 and 1,
    inclusively. This wrapper function would select the best
    \eqn{alpha} and reports the stramash item based on that \eqn{alpha}.
}
\details{
All other inputs are exactly the same as the main function
    stramash, and would pass to the main function to evaluate the
    likelihood.

\examples{
beta = c(rep(0,100),rnorm(100))
sebetahat = abs(rnorm(200,0,1))
betahat = rnorm(200,beta,sebetahat)
#beta.stramashm = stramashm(betahat, sebetahat,alpha=6)
#beta.stramashm4 = stramashm(betahat, sebetahat,alpha=6,ncores=4)
#print(beta.stramashm[[1]])  #best stramash object
#print(beta.stramashm[[2]])  #corresponding model type
#print(beta.stramashm[[3]])  #log-likelihood for all models

# STRAMASH: Specifying The Right Amount of Mixture-likelihood for Adaptive SHrinkage
This package is similar to and depends on the `ashr` package
([https://github.com/stephens999/ashr](https://github.com/stephens999/ashr))
but also allows the error distribution to be any mixture of normals or
uniforms. See that link for details on the model.

Right now, only using a mixture of uniforms as your error distribution
is gauranteed to work properly.

# Installation
To install, run the following code in R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dcgerard/stramash")
```

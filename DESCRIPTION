Title: STRAMASH: Specifying The Right Amount of Mixture-likelihood for Adaptive SHrinkage
Description: This package is similar to and depends on the ashr
    package, but allows for any mixture likelihood. The main function
    in the stramash package is \code{\link{stramash}}, which should be
    examined for more details. For simplicity only the most commonly-
    used options are documented under \code{\link{stramash}}. For
    expert or interested users the documentation for function
    \code{\link{stramash.workhorse}} provides documentation on all
    implemented options.
